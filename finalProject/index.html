    <h2> Vinyl </h2>
    <p> The analogue format made of polyvinyl chloride had been the main vehicle for the commercial distribution of pop music from the 1950s until the 1980s and 1990s when they were largely replaced by the Compact Disc. Since the turn of the millenium, CDs have been partially replaced by digital downloads. However, in 2007, vinyl sales made a sudden small increase, starting its comeback, and by the early 2010s it was growing at a very fast rate. In some territories, vinyl is now more popular than it has been since the late 1980s, though vinyl records still make up only a marginal percentage ( 6%) of overall music sales</p>
    <p>I've always been a big fan of music, I listen to pretty much anything. From Classic Rock to Clssical music. From English Music to Spanish even some Italian. Sometime is about the melody or the beat of a song another times is the lyrics that catch my attention but every time they tell me something and for the most part i identify myself with it at a certain moment in my life. like I believe so everyone else sometime i think of a certain song as a soundtrack of an episode in my life story. </p>
    <p> In the last few months I have started to buy and collect Viynl Albums because why not right?</p><p>Here I will feature my current collection as well as any new albums I Acquire</p>
