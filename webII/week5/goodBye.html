    <p>The beginning. CATHERINE, at the end of her first date with Jamie. <br>

        <img src="images/last5yrs.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="246" align="right"/>Don't kiss me goodbye again.<br>
        Leave this night clean and quiet.<br>
        You want the last word,<br>
        You want me to laugh, <br>
        But leave it for now.<br>
        <br>
        All you can say,<br>
        All you can feel<br>
        Was wrapped up inside that one perfect kiss.<br>
        Leave it at that:<br>
        I'll watch you turn the corner and go...<br>
        <br>
        And goodbye until tomorrow.<br>
        Goodbye until the next time you call,<br>
        And I will be waiting.<br>
        I will be waiting.<br>
        Goodbye until tomorrow.<br>
        Goodbye 'til I recall how to breathe,<br>
        And I have been waiting,<br>
        I have been waiting for you.<br>
        <br>
        I stand on a precipice.<br>
        I struggle to keep my balance.<br>
        I open myself,<br>
        I open myself one stitch at a time.<br>
        <br>
        Finally yes!<br>
        Finally now!<br>
        Finally something takes me away.<br>
        Finally free!<br>
        Finally he can cut through these strings,<br>
        And open my wings!<br>
        <br>
        So goodbye until tomorrow!<br>
        Goodbye until my feet touch the floor,<br>
        And I will be waiting,<br>
        I will be waiting!<br>
        Goodbye until tomorrow!<br>
        Goodbye until the rest of my life<br>
        And I have been waiting,<br>
        I have been waiting for you!<br>
        Waiting for you,<br>
        Waiting for you!<br>
        <br>
        The end. JAMIE, alone in the apartment.<br>
        <br>
        JAMIE:<br>
        <br>
        I called Elise to help me pack my bags.<br>
        I went downtown and closed the bank account.<br>
        It's not about another shrink,<br>
        It's not about another compromise.<br>
        I'm not the only one who's hurting here.<br>
        I don't know what the Hell is left to do.<br>
        You never saw how far the crack had opened.<br>
        You never knew I had run out of rope and<br>
        <br>
        I could never rescue you. <br>
        All you ever wanted,<br>
        But I could never rescue you,<br>
        No matter how I tried.<br>
        All I could do was love you hard<br>
        And let you go.<br>
        <br>
        No matter how I tried,<br>
        All I could do was love you.<br>
        God, how I loved you so.<br>
        So we could fight,<br>
        Or we could wait,<br>
        Or I could go...<br>
        <br>
        CATHERINE:<br>
        <br>
        Goodbye until tomorrow!<br>
        Goodbye until I crawl to your door,<br>
        And I will be waiting,<br>
        I will be waiting!<br>
        <br>
        JAMIE:<br>
        <br>
        You never noticed how<br>
        The wind had changed.<br>
        <br>
        CATHERINE: (JAMIE:)<br>
        <br>
        Goodbye until tomorrow<br>
        (I didn't see a way we both could win)<br>
        <br>
        CATHERINE:<br>
        <br>
        Goodbye until I'm done thanking God, <br>
        For I have been waiting!<br>
        I have been waiting for you!<br>
        <br>
        CATHERINE: (JAMIE:)<br>
        <br>
        I have been waiting!<br>
        (Goodbye, Cathy)<br>
        I have been waiting for you!<br>
        (Goodbye!)<br>
        <br>
        CATHERINE:<br>
        <br>
        I will keep waiting--<br>
        I will be waiting for you!<br>
        <br>
        Just close the gate;<br>
        I'll stand and wait.<br>
        Jamie...<br>
        <br>
        BOTH:<br>
        <br>
        Goodbye. </p>
