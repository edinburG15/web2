  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a story. A little Christmas Story.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call it "The Story of Schmuel, Tailor of Klimovich"<br>
<br>
Schmuel would work till half-past ten at his tailor shop in Klimovich<br>
Get up at dawn and start again with the hems and pins and twist<br>
Forty-one years had come and gone at his tailor shop in Klimovich<br>
Watching the winters soldier on, there was one thing Schmuel missed<br>
<br>
"If I only had time," old Schmuel said<br>
"I would build the dress that's in my head<br>
A dress to fire<br>
The mad desire<br>
Of girls from here to Minsk<br>
But I have no more hours left to sew"<br>
Then the clock upon the wal began to <em>glow</em>...<br>
<br>
And the clock said:<br>
"Na na na na, na na na<br>
Oh Schmuel, you'll get to be happy!<br>
Na na na na, na na na<br>
I give you unlimited time!<br>
Na na na na, na na na<br>
So Schmuel, go sew and be happy!"<br>
But Schmuel said<br>
"No, no, it's not my lot<br>
I've gotta make do witht he time I've got"<br>
<br>
Schmuel was done at half-past ten and he said "Good night, old Klimovich"<br>
Put on his coat to go, but then the clock cried, "Wait! Not yet!<br>
Even though you're not wise or rich<br>
You're the finest man in Klimovich<br>
Listen up, Schmuel<br>
Make one stitch and you'll see what you get"<br>
<br>
But Schmuel said<br>
"Clock, it's much too late<br>
I'm at peace with life<br>
I accept my fate..."<br>
But the clock said<br>
"Schmuel! One stitch and you will<br>
Unlock the dreams you've lost!"<br>
So Schmuel, with reluctance, took his thread<br>
He pulled a bolt of velvet and said<br>
"I should take out my teeth and go to bed<br>
I'm sitting her with talking clocks instead!"<br>
<br>
And the clock said:<br>
"Na na na na, na na na<br>
Oh Schmuel, you'll get to be happy!<br>
Na na na na, na na na,<br>
I give you unlimited time<br>
Na na na na, na na na<br>
Just do it and you can be happy!"<br>
<br>
So Schmuel put the thread through the needle's eye<br>
And the moon stared down from a starless sky<br>
And he pushed the thread through the velvet black<br>
And he looked, and the clock was turning...back<br>
<br>
So he grabbed his shears and he cut some lace<br>
As the hands moved left on the old clock's face<br>
And his fingers flew and the fabric swirled<br>
It was nine-fifteen all around the world<br>
<br>
Every cut and stitch was a perfect fit<br>
As if God Himself were controlling it!<br>
And Schmuel cried through a rush of tears<br>
"Take me back! Take me back all forty-one years!"<br>
<br>
And on it went down that silent street<br>
Till Schmuel's dress was at last complete<br>
And he stretched his arms<br>
And he closed his eyes<br>
And the morning sun finally started to rise<br>
<br>
And the dress he made on that endless night<br>
Was a dress that would make any soul take flight<br>
Not a swatch, not a skein had gone to waste<br>
Every ribbon and button ideally placed<br>
And swen into the seams were forty-one seasons of dreams<br>
Dreams that you could feel<br>
Coming real<br>
<br>
And that very dress, so the papers swore<br>
Was the dress a girl in Odessa wore<br>
On the day she promised forevermore<br>
To love a young man named Schmuel<br>
Who only one day before<br>
Had knocked at her kitchen door<br>
<br>
Plenty have hoped and dreamed and prayed<br>
But they can't get out of Klimovich<br>
If Schmuel had been a cute goyishe maid<br>
He'd've looked a lot like you<br>
Maybe it's just that you're afraid to go out on to a limb-ovich<br>
Maybe your heart's completely swayed<br>
But your head can't follow through<br>
<br>
But shouldn't I want the world to see<br>
The brilliant girl who inspires me?<br>
Don't you think that now's a good time to be<br>
The ambitious freak you are?<br>
Say goodbye to wiping ashtrays at the bar<br>
Say hello to Cathy Hiatt, big-time star!<br>
'Cause I say:<br>
Na na na na na na na na<br>
Cathy, you get to be happy!<br>
Na na na na na na na<br>
I give you unlimited time!<br>
Na na na na na na na<br>
Stop temping and go and be happy!<br>
<br>
Here's a headshot guy and a new BackStage<br>
Where you're right for something on every page<br>
Take a breath<br>
Take a step<br>
Take a chance<br>
<br>
Take your time<br>
Have I mentioned today<br>
How lucky I am<br>
To be in love with you?! </p>
